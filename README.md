# verification-pipelined-MIPS-with-UVM

This project contains the simulation and functional verification of a MIPS processor by using universal verification methodology (UVM). The MIPS processor discussed has been designed with system verilog and has been previously simulated using Questa through a Linux virtual machine using a custom testbench. In this project a custom UVM Development Environment has been designed in order to test multiple instructions which are made possible by the simulated processor.
